        <h1>Data science</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p><b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from a multitude of structured and unstructured data.Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.</p>
    <p>Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.</p>

        <b>1-Foundation</b>
        <hr>
        <p> Data science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are usually large (see Big Data). The domain includes analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in the organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business. Statistician Nathan Yao, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: Users must be able to intuitively control and explore data. In 2015, the American Statistical Association defined database management, statistics, machine learning, and parallel distribution and systems as the three emerging foundational professional societies.</p>  
        <b>Relationship to statistics</b>
        <p>Several statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics. Others argue that data science differs from statistics in that it focuses on the unique problems and technologies of digital data. Vasant Dar writes that statistics confirm quantitative and descriptive data. In contrast, data science deals with both quantitative and qualitative data (such as images) and emphasizes forecasting and action. Andrew Gilman of Columbia University and data scientist Vincent Granville described statistics as a non-essential part of data science. Stanford professor David Donoho writes that data science is not distinguished from statistics by size of data sets or computing use, and that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their training in analytics and statistics as the core of their data science program. He describes data science as an applied field that emerges from traditional statistics.
            In short, data science can be described as an applied branch of statistics.</p>

        <b>2-Etymology</b>
        <hr>
        <b>Early usage</b>
        <p>In 1962, John Tookie described a field he called "data analysis," which is analogous to modern data science. In 1985, in a lecture given at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, CF Geoff Wu used the term data science for the first time as an alternate name for statistics. Later, attendees at the 1992 Statistics Seminar at the University of Montpellier II acknowledged the emergence of a new discipline focusing on data of various origins and forms, combining the concepts and well-established principles of statistics and data analysis with computing.

            The term "data science" dates back to 1974, when it was proposed by Peter Nauer as an alternate name for computer science. In 1996, the International Federation of Classification Societies became the first conference to specifically introduce data science as a topic. However, the definition was still in flux. After a 1985 lecture at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, CF Jeff Wu in 1997 suggested again that statistics should be renamed data science. He believed that the new name would help statistics get rid of inaccurate stereotypes, such as being synonymous with accounting, or limited to describing data. In 1998, Chikio Hayashi argued for data science as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection and analysis.
            
            During the 1990s, common terms for finding patterns in data sets (which were increasingly large) included "knowledge discovery" and "data mining".</p>
            <br>
        <b>Modern usage</b>
        <p>The modern concept of data science as an autonomous system is sometimes attributed to William S. Cleveland. In a 2001 paper, he advocated expanding statistics beyond theory in technical fields. Because this would change the domain drastically, it guarantees a new name. “Data science” became widely used in the next few years: In 2002, the Data Science and Technology Committee launched the Data Science Journal. In 2003, Columbia University launched the Journal of Data Science. In 2014, the American Statistical Association, the Department of Statistical Learning and Data Mining, changed its name to the Division of Statistical Learning and Data Science, reflecting the growing popularity of data science.

            The professional title "Data Scientist" was attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008. Although used by the National Science Council in their 2005 report, Long-Life Digital Data Sets: Enabling Research and Education in the Twenty-first Century, he generally noted To any major role in managing digital data collection.
            
            There is still no consensus on the definition of data science, and some consider it a buzzword.</p>

        <b>3-Impact</b>
        <hr>
        <p>Big data is fast becoming a vital tool for businesses and businesses of all sizes. The availability and interpretation of big data changed the business models of old industries and enabled the creation of new industries. The data-driven business is valued at $ 1.2 trillion combined in 2020, up from $ 333 billion in 2015. Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating programs and algorithms that help companies and organizations define optimal processes. As big data continues to influence the world, data science also works due to the close relationship between the two.</p>
